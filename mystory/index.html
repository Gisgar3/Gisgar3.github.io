		<p style="font-family:tahoma; color:white; font-size:18px;">The first time I was really interested in learning how to program was when my school starting advertising a coding site; which mainly specialized <br>in JavaScript. I thought the website was pretty decent; had input and output boxes that actually showed the running code too. That was <br> when I knew I wanted to learn more about programming. I went home after school for days and worked on learning JavaScript. I <br>still have notebooks filled with my old learning code. After finishing my full tutorial, I started my first project! Minecraft was starting <br>to become more popular at the time, so modding the game seemed like a good idea to get my thoughts out there. My first(and only) mod on <br>Minecraft was a chocolate mod. It was very basic, it contained only a few food items and blocks, obviously made out of chocolate! I was very <br>proud of myself, it was my first coding project that worked out pretty well-atleast for awhile. I lost most of my code from a data corruption.<br> Some code still exists, but it would be useless these days, the code is very outdated. Now, to the present!<br><br>Now in 2017, I specialize in C# software development, and also manage a small organization called <a href="https://www.github.com/StableProgramming" target="_blank">Stable Programming</a>.
